# holbertonschool-sorting_algorithms

This repository contains C implementations of classic sorting algorithms, including Insertion Sort (for Doubly Linked Lists), Selection Sort (for arrays), and Quick Sort (for arrays). Each implementation adheres to strict requirements, such as printing the state of the list or array after every swap operation.

All algorithms are analyzed in terms of their time complexity using Big O notation for the best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
